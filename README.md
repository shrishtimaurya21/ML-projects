# 📧 Email Spam Detection System using Naive Bayes

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam (Ham)** using the **Naive Bayes algorithm**.  
This project demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation for a real-world NLP problem.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
Email spam detection is a classic **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** problem.  
This system automatically identifies unwanted spam emails based on their content using a probabilistic machine learning approach.

---

## ✨ Features
- Email text preprocessing (cleaning & normalization)
- Feature extraction using **Bag of Words / TF-IDF**
- Spam classification using **Naive Bayes**
- Model evaluation with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Predicts whether a new email is **Spam or Ham**

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **NLTK**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
